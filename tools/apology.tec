jsthank youli
We apologize for that fact that the VMS Version 4
development workload rendered us unable to process your Version 3.x SPR in a
timely manner.  We are studying methods to allow better response to SPRs in 
the future regardless of current development load, and we do not intend that
this situation recur.
