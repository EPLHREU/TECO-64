## TECO-64 - User-Definable Keys

The following are the keys that can be mapped to Q-registers.
They are specified using the text argument for an FM command. The text
argument is not case-sensitive.

Under certain conditions, or in certain operating environments, some
of these may not work. Also, more keys may be added later, to make use
of combinations of the meta keys (e.g., Ctrl or Alt).

The arrow keys (up, down, right, left) have predefined actions, but
can be remapped if desired. And if they are unmapped, they revert to
their original behavior.
