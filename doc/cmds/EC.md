### EC - Close File or Set Memory Size

The EC command performs two functions.
The first, without a numeric argument, closes the input and output files.
The second, with a numeric argument, changes the memory size
used for the text buffer.

EC
- Moves the contents of the text buffer, plus the remainder of
the current input file on the currently selected input stream, to
the current output file on the currently selected output stream;
then closes those input and output files. Control remains in
TECO. EC leaves the text buffer empty.

*n*EC
- *n*EC tells TECO to expand or contract until it uses *n*K
bytes of memory for its text buffer. If this is not possible,
then TECOâ€™s memory usage does not change. The 0EC command
tells TECO to use the least amount of memory possible.
