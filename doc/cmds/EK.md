### EK - Edit Kill

EK
- Kill the current output file on the currently selected output
stream. This command, which purges the output file without
closing it, is useful to abort an undesired edit. Executing the
EK command after an EW which is superseding an existing file
leaves the old file intact. The EK command also "undoes" an
EB command.
