### I - Insert String

I*text*$
- Where *text* is a string of ASCII characters terminated by
a <DELIM>. The specified text string is entered into the
buffer at the current position of the pointer, with the pointer
positioned immediately after the last character of the insertion.

*n*I$ This form of the I command inserts the single character whose
ASCII code is *n* into the buffer at the current position of the
buffer pointer. (*n* is taken modulo 256) *n*I$ is used to insert
characters that are not available on the userâ€™s terminal or special
characters such as DELETE which may not be inserted from a terminal
with the standard I command.

@I/*text*/
- Equivalent to the I command except that the text to be inserted
may contain ESCAPE characters. A delimiting character (shown as a
slash here) must precede and follow the text to be inserted.

*n*@I//
- Equivalent to the *n*I$ command, but does not require the <DELIM>
character.

*m*,*n*I$
- Equivalent to executing the *n*I$ command *m* times.
If *m* is not specified, one character is inserted. If *m* is 0, then
no character is inserted. If *m* is negative, then an IIA (illegal
insert argument) error occurs.

*m*,*n*@I//
- Equivalent to the *m*,*n*I$ command.
