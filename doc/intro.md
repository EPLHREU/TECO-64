## TECO-64 - Introduction

TECO is a text editor for editing ASCII files. It can be executed
either interactively, using a simple command-line interface, or with
a display mode that includes the ability to define separate regions
in a window for both an edit buffer and TECO commands.

TECO is also a programming or scripting language that allows users to
create *macros* for processing text or files, using a terse syntax
designed to minimize keystrokes, that makes it possible to:

- Read, write, and find files.
- Insert and delete characters, strings, and numbers.
- Search for text, optionally using pattern matching constructs
(similar to regular expressions).
- Search for and replace text.
- Control execution with subroutines, looping constructs, and
unconditional (*goto*) and conditional (*if-then-else*) branches.
- Calculate numeric values using expressions that can make use of a
wide variety of arithmetic operators.
- Print messages on the user's terminal containing both strings and
numbers.
- Function as both a floor wax *AND* a dessert topping (just kidding!)

As a consequence, the ability to use and combine these and other
features provides TECO macros the versatility to be used for tasks
ranging from simple to complex. These macros may either be saved
internally in TECO, or stored in files that can be subsequently
executed as stand-alone programs.

However, it is also possible with just a few commands to get real
work done, and a novice TECO user can begin creating and editing
text files after a brief instruction. More powerful features can
be learned at leisure.

This manual presents TECO in two stages. First, it provides basic
information and introduces a simple set of commands. Then subsequent
sections describe the full TECO command set, including a more complete
description of the commands initially presented. These sections also
introduce the concept of TECO as a programming language and explain
how basic editing commands may be combined into programs sophisticated
enough to handle even complicated editing tasks.
