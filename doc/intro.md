## TECO-64 - Introduction

TECO is:

- A powerful text editor, able to edit any form of ASCII text, such
as program sources, command procedures, or manuscripts.
- Able to be used for tasks ranging from simple to complex.
- A character-oriented editor which provides many commands for
processing text.
- Able to be used interactively, where commands are executed as soon as
they are typed in.
- Allows the creation of command sequences called macros, which can
be either stored internally and then invoked by short commands, or
stored in files to be executed at a later time.
- An implementation language that provides powerful primitive
functions for text processing, screen handling, and keyboard
management.

TECO correctly handles most sequential ASCII formats supported by the
operating systems upon which it runs. It provides flexible pattern-matching
constructs for text searching, and file wildcarding.
A split screen scrolling feature allows command dialogue to share the
screen with an automatically-updated window into an edit buffer that
displays the text to be modified.

TECOâ€™s syntax is terse; commands are designed to minimize keystrokes.
Also, the versatility of TECO makes it complex. However, just a few
commands suffice to get real work done, and a novice TECO user can begin
creating and editing text files after a brief instruction. More
powerful features can be learned at leisure.

This manual presents TECO in two stages. The first part contains basic
information and introduces a simple set of commands.

Subsequent chapters describe the full TECO command set, including a review
of the those commands presented in (TBD). These section also introduce
the concept of TECO as a programming language and explain how basic editing
commands may be combined into programs sophisticated enough to handle the
most complicated editing tasks.

The early sections of this manual include few specific examples of commands,
since all TECO commands have a consistent, logical format which will quickly
become apparent to the beginning user.

This manual is intended to be used for reference, and except for the section
titled Basics of TECO, is not a tutorial. It is subsequently assumed that
the reader has a general familiarity with TECO and is referring to this manual
to find detailed information.
