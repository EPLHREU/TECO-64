The makefile included with this distribution is intended to be used with the GNU

or

    make teco

An executable image will be created in the bin/ directory, and can then be used
to print a list of command-line options by typing

    bin/teco --help    

If Doxygen is installed, documentation may be created in the html/ directory by
typing

    make doc

or

    make doxygen
